            <h3>Practice Implications</h3>
            <p class="content-subtitle">Draft for: Qualitative Study Examining CTE Health Science Pathway Students' Involvement in Practicing and Promoting Mental Wellness</p>

            <div class="content-body">
                <p>As artificial intelligence transforms healthcare delivery, the findings from this qualitative study become increasingly salient for CTE educators, career counselors, and program administrators. While AI-driven tools promise to revolutionize clinical detection and diagnostic support, the relational competencies identified among Health Science Pathway students—peer connection, storytelling, trusted mentorship, and servant leadership—represent irreplaceable human capacities that must be deliberately cultivated alongside technical AI literacy.</p>

                <h4>AI-Augmented Detection, Human-Driven Intervention</h4>
                <p>Recent advances in AI-based mental health screening demonstrate significant promise for early identification of at-risk adolescents through analysis of digital phenotypes, natural language processing of text-based expressions, and predictive algorithms integrated into mobile health platforms (Murphy, 2024; Frontiers in Psychiatry, 2026). However, the present study's findings underscore a critical limitation of these technological advances: identification alone does not produce help-seeking behavior. Participants consistently described that their willingness to seek support emerged from authentic peer relationships and trusted mentorship—precisely the relational dynamics that AI cannot replicate. This suggests a complementary model wherein AI augments early detection capabilities while human relationships drive the actual intervention and recovery process.</p>

                <h4>Redefining CTE Competencies for an AI-Augmented Healthcare Workforce</h4>
                <p>Health Science Pathway programs must now prepare students for a dual reality: technical proficiency with AI tools and deeply human relational skills. Current research indicates that medical education has been slow to integrate AI literacy curricula, with most students lacking understanding of basic technical principles underlying AI systems (JMIR Medical Education, 2024; Lancet eClinicalMedicine, 2024). Simultaneously, the peer support and social-emotional competencies demonstrated by participants in this study align with emerging evidence that school connectedness and positive social relationships serve as protective factors against poor mental health outcomes (CDC, 2024; ScienceDirect, 2025). CTE programs are uniquely positioned to bridge this gap by integrating AI fundamentals—data literacy, algorithm evaluation, ethical considerations—alongside the interpersonal competencies participants naturally developed through their CTSO involvement.</p>

                <h4>Protecting the Protective Factors</h4>
                <p>The study's five emergent themes—stigma reduction, peer support, resilience building, student wellness promotion, and servant leadership—represent protective factors that technology cannot manufacture. A systematic review of peer-led health behavior interventions found that such programs leverage existing social networks and reduce stigma with high implementation feasibility, though their effectiveness varies by context (Scientific Reports, 2025). The community of belonging participants described, cultivated through shared purpose and reciprocal mentorship, produced psychological safety that enabled vulnerable help-seeking conversations. As healthcare increasingly incorporates AI-driven efficiency measures, program administrators must intentionally preserve spaces for these relational protective factors.</p>

                <h4>Implications for Program Design</h4>
                <p>These findings suggest several actionable recommendations for Health Science Pathway programs:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Integrate AI literacy with relational skill development</strong> rather than treating them as separate competency domains</li>
                    <li><strong>Preserve CTSO-based peer mentoring structures</strong> as essential components of student wellness infrastructure, not optional extracurriculars</li>
                    <li><strong>Train instructors as wellness-aware mentors</strong> who can model help-seeking behavior and facilitate psychological safety</li>
                    <li><strong>Document and assess relational competencies</strong> alongside technical skills in program evaluation frameworks</li>
                    <li><strong>Partner with mental health professionals</strong> to develop referral pathways that students can navigate through peer support networks</li>
                </ol>

                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>The servant leadership orientation participants described—using their healthcare knowledge to support peers while developing their own professional identity—exemplifies the integration of technical and relational competencies that the AI-augmented healthcare workforce will require. As AI assumes increasing diagnostic and administrative functions, the distinctly human capacity for compassionate presence, authentic connection, and meaning-making through shared narrative will differentiate effective healthcare professionals. CTE Health Science Pathway programs that cultivate these competencies prepare students not merely to coexist with AI but to fulfill the irreplaceable human roles that technology cannot assume.</p>

            <p class="content-subtitle">New paragraphs with citations for manuscript integration</p>

            <div class="content-body">
                <h4>1. AI in Healthcare Education</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The rapid integration of artificial intelligence into healthcare delivery has created urgent demand for AI literacy among healthcare professionals and students. A systematic review published in JMIR Medical Education identified key competency areas for AI implementation, including fundamental AI knowledge with emphasis on evaluating algorithm validity rather than programming skills, data analysis capabilities, and understanding of ethical and legal considerations (JMIR Medical Education, 2025). However, a scoping review of curriculum frameworks found that while several AI literacy frameworks exist—including the AI Literacy Competency Framework and AI4K12: 5 Big Ideas Framework—each target audience requires specialized curricula tailored to their educational needs (JMIR Medical Education, 2024). Medical schools and postgraduate clinical training programs have been notably slow to integrate AI education, with most medical students lacking understanding of basic technical principles underlying AI (Lancet eClinicalMedicine, 2024). Research suggests that students using AI-based educational platforms achieve mastery rates up to 30% higher in complex topics, and AI-driven simulations accelerate procedural skill acquisition 2.6 times faster than traditional instruction (BMC Medical Education, 2025).</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>2. AI in Mental Health Detection and Intervention</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly embedded in youth mental health care, with applications spanning early detection, diagnostic decision-making, treatment delivery, and clinician training (Current Treatment Options in Psychiatry, 2025). A systematic scoping review of AI in adolescent mental health care identified 88 relevant papers published through July 2024, documenting machine learning applications for diagnosing depression, schizophrenia, and suicide risk, with emerging applications for anxiety and behavioral disorders (JMIR Mental Health, 2025). Novel AI-based diagnostic systems utilizing multi-task deep learning can predict comorbid depression and anxiety severity based on spontaneous textual expressions, addressing limitations of traditional screening tools like PHQ-9 and GAD-7, which suffer from subjective bias, recall errors, and underreporting due to social stigma (Frontiers in Psychiatry, 2026). Mobile health platforms employing predictive AI represent a potential solution for the youth mental health crisis, which is exacerbated by limited access to care (ScienceDirect, 2024). However, vulnerable populations who most need AI-assisted screening face a "digital divide" and "knowledge gap" between urban and rural youth in access to digital technologies and services (PMC, 2022).</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>3. CTE and Workforce Development (Post-2020)</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Career and technical education has experienced significant transformation and investment since 2020. Federal legislation including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021) and the CHIPS and Science Act (2022) explicitly included workforce development funding, with CTE programs serving as key vehicles for training (Congress.gov, 2022). States and school districts used pandemic recovery funds to expand high-quality CTE programs, upgrade facilities, and offer reskilling programs for adults, with many investing in dual enrollment options blending high school and college-level CTE (American Institutes for Research, 2024). Health science remains the largest CTE cluster, driven by growing population and consistent demand for health science professionals (iCEV Online, 2023). Notably, public perceptions of traditional higher education have shifted: a 2023 Wall Street Journal-NORC poll found 56% of Americans do not believe a four-year degree is worth the cost, up from 40% in 2013 (Education Next, 2024). Federal funding for CTE exceeded $1.462 billion in 2023, with Perkins V legislation requiring states to align programs with high-wage, in-demand occupations (ACTE, 2024).</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>4. Youth Mental Health Trends (2020-2026)</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The period since 2020 has seen both documentation of a youth mental health crisis and emerging evidence of protective factors. CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey data (2013-2023) revealed that high school students experiencing persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness increased from 30% to 40%, while those seriously considering suicide rose from 17% to 20% (CDC, 2024). While August 2024 data indicated some improvements, significant disparities persisted among female and LGBTQ+ students, who reported higher rates of violence, poor mental health, and suicidal thoughts; nearly three in ten LGBTQ+ students were bullied at school, and two in ten attempted suicide in 2023 (CDC Newsroom, 2024). Among adolescents needing treatment, 61% reported difficulty accessing care in 2023—a 35% increase since 2018 with notable acceleration after 2020—while 52% of public schools struggled to provide effective mental health services (Annie E. Casey Foundation, 2024). In response, school connectedness has emerged as a critical protective factor (CDC Healthy Youth, 2024).</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>5. Peer Support Interventions</h4>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The role of peer support in adolescent mental health has received substantial research attention since 2020. A systematic review and meta-analysis of peer-led health behavior interventions encompassing 7,060 adolescents from 151 schools found that such programs leverage existing social networks and reduce stigma with high implementation feasibility, though their effectiveness for mental health outcomes varies by context (Scientific Reports, 2025). Peer relationships become increasingly important during adolescence, a peak developmental period for mental health difficulties, with young people citing friends as the most common source of mental health information and support (Wiley Journal of Community Psychology, 2024). Crucially, peer support principles differ from traditional client-clinician relationships through mutual connection, shared knowledge, and reciprocal support, potentially serving as an "entry way" to mental health care for those hesitant to seek professional help (PMC, 2024).</p>
